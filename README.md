# AgentSentient
Sentient Program for Market Prediction for product
This agent helps you to categorize the product as excellent or trash given certain features which are boolean variables.
It uses various Scikit learn classifiers like BNB, SVC, LR.

The file is divided into two parts:
1. Base Agent: smartagent file
2. Agent Implementation: Agent_sentient - which is aware of everything hmm atleast in this scenario if trained well :)

You can run the program by using the simulate agent which tests the agent implementation with some base dumb agents.
